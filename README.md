# BUMI - Neural Network Classification Model

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to train a 2D classification model using a neural network implemented with Keras and optimized using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision.

## 📌 Project Overview

- A synthetic 2D classification dataset is generated.
- The model is built using Keras with:
  - Dense layers
  - Dropout regularization
  - Early stopping callback
- Evaluated on key metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**
- Visualization of loss curve for training and validation.

## 📁 Contents

- `One.ipynb`: The main Colab notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and model evaluation.
